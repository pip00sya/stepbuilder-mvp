AI meets WordPress. Your site can now chat, write poetry, solve problems, and maybe make you coffee.

== Description ==
AI Engine seamlessly connects WordPress with the world of AI. It brings modern AI capabilities straight into your site, letting you work smarter without leaving your dashboard. From writing and translating content to generating images and managing media, everything is tightly integrated so you can stay focused on what matters.

You can create a chatbot to assist your visitors, answer support questions, or guide users through your products and services. Need fresh content? AI Engine can write posts in your voice, help rewrite existing ones, or translate them naturally into other languages. It can also generate custom images for your articles, refine messy text, or just lend a hand when you’re stuck.

For developers and power users, AI Engine offers internal APIs, shortcode flexibility, and advanced features like function calling and real-time audio chat. You can build your own AI-powered tools, automate tasks, or even create AI-driven SaaS applications on top of WordPress. And with support for a wide range of providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, and more—you have full control over the models you want to use.

Everything is designed to feel native to WordPress. Whether you're exploring ideas in the AI Playground, using Copilot to help in the editor, or letting an AI agent manage your content through MCP, AI Engine is built to grow with you—and shaped by real user feedback every step of the way.

Please make sure you read the [disclaimer](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/disclaimer/). For more tutorial and information, check the official website: [AI Engine](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/). Thank you!

== Features ==

* **Model Management**: Effortlessly bring the latest AI models (GPT 4.1, Claude, Gemini, o3, o4, 4o, and more) to your WordPress. Quickly set your preferred models to match your specific WordPress workflows.
* **Chatbots**: Easily create interactive chatbots. Customize themes, avatars, and conversation flows to fit your brand or use case.
* **AI Forms**: Build AI-driven forms that handle text, images, audio, or file uploads—perfect for advanced support tickets, creative prompts, or user submissions.
* **Copilot**: Transform the WordPress editor into your personal AI assistant. Simply hit “space” or use the wand icons to get real-time suggestions, quick translations, or content rewrites.
* **Image & Translation**: Create images from prompts, break language barriers with instant translations, and quickly refine existing text for clarity and SEO.
* **Finetuning & Embeddings**: Fine-tune AI models to match your domain or style, and use embeddings for smarter AI interactions, content classification, or personalized recommendations.
* **Discussions & Memory Tracking**: Let users engage in longer or more complex conversations with the chatbot. All data can be stored, analyzed, and even exported for further insights.
* **Function Calling**: Connect the AI models to your WordPress functions, tools, or APIs. For example, you can use the chatbot to allow your users to interact with your store, book appointments, or get real-time data.
* **Internal & External APIs**: Integrate AI Engine’s capabilities into other plugins or custom applications through built-in internal APIs or via REST—perfect for building advanced WordPress SaaS solutions.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Allow powerful AI agents (like Claude) to fully control and manage your WordPress site. Automate posts, content updates, manage media, and seamlessly integrate advanced AI workflows. AI Engine can also connect to external MCP servers, expanding your AI's capabilities beyond WordPress.
* **AI-Powered Search**: Enhance WordPress search with three intelligent methods: standard WordPress search, AI-generated progressive keyword search that creates multiple search variations with decreasing specificity, and embeddings-based semantic search for meaning-based results.
* **PDF Import for Embeddings**: Import PDF documents with automatic chunking, title generation, and intelligent content extraction for building comprehensive knowledge bases.
* **Insights & Usage Control**: Track usage, monitor tokens, and manage costs with detailed analytics. Tools like role-based access, banned words, or content safety filters help you maintain a secure environment.
* **Extensive Integration**: Seamlessly works with Media File Renamer, SEO Engine, Social Engine, Code Engine, and other WordPress plugins to power advanced AI features site-wide.
* **Flexible Theming & Shortcodes**: Control the look and behavior of your AI integrations using pre-built themes or your own custom CSS. Place chatbots or AI-driven forms anywhere using simple shortcodes.

Please note that some features require a Pro license (AI Forms, Embeddings, Usage Control, Realtime Chatbot). For more information, check the [official website](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/).

== MCP (Model Context Protocol) ==

While WordPress core may one day add MCP support, AI Engine is already there. We've built a smart wrapper around WordPress's Core API that turns your site into an intelligent MCP server.

This means AI agents like Claude and ChatGPT can connect directly to your WordPress site and actually understand how it works. They can browse your content, edit articles, check SEO, manage your media files, and handle complex tasks without getting confused or lost like they do with regular APIs.

The best part? Other plugins can easily add their own features to this MCP system. [SEO Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-engine/), [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/), and [Code Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-engine/) are already connecting (or will be soon), so AI agents can manage your entire WordPress site just like a skilled human would.

AI Engine also works the other way around—it can connect to external MCP servers, giving your AI access to tools and services beyond WordPress. This means your chatbots and AI assistants can tap into a growing ecosystem of MCP-enabled applications and APIs.

== Beyond the Features ==

Since AI Engine has its own internal APIs, this allows you and others to integrate AI features to your WordPress. It has been officially integrated with many plugins to enhance their functionality. Here are a few examples:

* [Media File Renamer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-file-renamer/)
* [SEO Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-engine/)
* [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/)
* [Code Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-engine/)

== My Dream for AI ==

I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can't help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let's be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.

I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too 💕
